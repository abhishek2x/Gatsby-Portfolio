excerpt: Not just a normal year

---


At the beginning of 2020, I was an introverted student who attends university classes in the morning and is up all night in the hostel room and keeps exploring various domains of technologies.

From the very beginning of my University, I found college classes to simple and kind of boring. After wasting an entire day at university, when I am back to the hostel, It’s time to do something productive. I keep looking at things which are interesting. I tried many things include Scripting, web development, ML/AI(only mathematics), cybersecurity, etc. Finally, Web development caught my eye.

I spend a lot of time, faced many problems, but I hardly knew someone who can help me. Now when I look back, I realise how common those problems are and everyone faces a similar problem.

As time moved ahead, I got involved in open-source communities, felt what it is like to work in a team. It was different, it changed the way I think of a problem. Later the same year, the skills which I learned helped me get an Internships and opportunity to Lead Google’s Developer Students Club at my University.
