Developer Student Clubs is an **initiative of Google Developers**. Google collaborates with *DSC Leads* once a year who are pursuing an undergraduate or graduate university degree and supports them as they start and grow their on-campus community.

The DSC program is a **grassroots channel** through which Google provides development skills, mobile and web development skills for students, towards employability. DSC activities are targeted at University students and others including faculty members who want to learn development skills & work to solve real-life problems.

We at DSC — VIT Bhopal look forward to form a community where we are able to convert our knowledge into real time application , help each student to develop in different fields of technology and make use of our knowledge to build something that helps local businesses around us as well as their community.
